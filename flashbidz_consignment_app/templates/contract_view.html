    initialed by both parties. If no alternate rate is written, the standard rates above apply.
</p>

<h2>4. Clean-Out, Disposal &amp; Marketing Fees (If Applicable)</h2>
<p>
    For estate or large-volume projects, the Consignor may agree to additional fees for services
    such as property clean-out, hauling, dumpster fees, labor, special advertising, or equipment rental.
    Any such fees will be listed below or on an attached schedule and will be deducted from the

<div class="box" style="min-height:70px;">
    <strong>Special Service Fees (if any):</strong><br>
    {{ contract.notes or "_______________________________" }}
</div>

<h2>5. Term, Exclusivity &amp; Price Control</h2>
<p>
    Consigned items remain under the exclusive control of FlashBidz for the duration of this Agreement.
    The Consignor agrees not to remove, sell, or give away items listed on this contract without first
    obtaining written permission from FlashBidz. FlashBidz will determine the timing, lot grouping,
    description, and starting prices at its professional discretion, taking into account the Consignor’s
    reasonable preferences when possible.
</p>

<h2>6. Condition, Descriptions &amp; No Guarantee</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Items are sold <strong>“AS IS, WHERE IS”</strong>, with no warranties expressed or implied.</li>
    <li>Descriptions and photos are based on information provided by the Consignor and visual inspection;
        FlashBidz is not responsible for hidden defects, authenticity of autographs/collectibles,
        or manufacturer representations.</li>
    <li>The Consignor affirms that all items are owned outright and are free of liens or
        undisclosed claims and that no stolen or illegal items are being consigned.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Sales Tax, Buyer’s Premium &amp; Payment Processing</h2>
<p>
    FlashBidz will collect applicable sales tax, buyer’s premium, and payment processing fees
    from buyers as required. These amounts are retained by FlashBidz and/or remitted to the
    taxing authorities and are not included in the Consignor’s share.
</p>

<h2>8. Payouts to Consignor</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Unless otherwise agreed in writing, FlashBidz will issue payment to the Consignor
        within <strong>30 days</strong> after the close of the auction or sale period, once
        buyer payments have cleared.</li>
    <li>Payment may be made by check, cash, or electronic payment method at FlashBidz’s discretion.</li>
    <li>FlashBidz may withhold payouts for unresolved chargebacks, non-paying bidders, returned items,
        or disputes relating to the consigned items until the issue is resolved.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Pickup, Storage &amp; Abandoned Property</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Winning bidders are generally allowed <strong>7 days</strong> from the end of the auction
        or sale to pick up purchased items, unless a different pickup window is advertised.</li>
    <li>After 7 days, FlashBidz may charge buyers a storage fee of
        <strong>$2.00 per item per day</strong>. These fees are retained by FlashBidz and are not
        shared with the Consignor.</li>
    <li>If a buyer fails to pay or pick up an item, FlashBidz may cancel the sale, re-sell the item,
        or dispose of it at its discretion. FlashBidz is not required to pay the Consignor for items
        that were never fully paid for by a buyer.</li>
    <li>Unpaid or unclaimed items that cannot be re-sold within a reasonable period may be considered
        abandoned and may be donated, discarded, or otherwise disposed of by FlashBidz without further
        notice to the Consignor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>10. Unsold Items</h2>
<p>
    FlashBidz and the Consignor will discuss how to handle unsold items after the primary sale period.
    Options may include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Re-listing in a future auction or sale;</li>
    <li>Moving to in-store retail or online marketplaces at the applicable commission rate;</li>
    <li>Donation to charity; or</li>
    <li>Return to the Consignor at the Consignor’s expense.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Unless otherwise stated in writing, items left with FlashBidz more than
    <strong>30 days after the end of the last scheduled sale</strong> for those items may be treated
    as <strong>abandoned</strong> and may be donated or disposed of at FlashBidz’s discretion.
</p>

<h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Reasonable care will be taken with consigned items; however, normal handling wear,
        shelf wear, and minor damage may occur in the ordinary course of moving and displaying items.</li>
    <li>FlashBidz is not responsible for loss or damage caused by fire, theft, water, acts of God,
        or circumstances beyond its reasonable control.</li>
    <li>In any event, FlashBidz’s maximum liability, if any, shall not exceed the amount that would
        have been payable to the Consignor as net proceeds for the affected item(s) if they had been sold
        under this Agreement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>12. Disputes &amp; Governing Law</h2>
<p>
    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Michigan. Any disputes arising out of this
    Agreement shall be handled first through good-faith discussions between the parties. If unresolved,
